    "ans:Imagine you want to know the average height of people in your city. You can't measure everyone, so you estimate by measuring a \n",

    "That's estimation statistics in a nutshell!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to estimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Point estimate:** This is like guessing a single number for the average height. For example, you might say the average height is\n",
    "170 cm based on your sample. It's simple but doesn't tell you how certain you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Interval estimate:** This is like giving a range where the true average height is likely to be. For example, you might say the average height \n",
    "is between 168 cm and 172 cm with 95% confidence. This is more informative because it considers the uncertainty in your estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation statistics helps you choose the right method, interpret your results, and understand how accurate your estimates are. It's like \n",

    "\n",
    "**Here's the gist:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set up the suspects:**\n",
    "    - **Null hypothesis (H0):** The usual suspect, assumes \"no change\" or things stay the same.\n",
    "    - **Alternative hypothesis (Ha):** The challenger, proposes your hunch is true and things are different.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gather clues (data):**\n",
    "    - Collect data from a representative sample of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analyze the evidence:**\n",
    "    - Use statistical tools to see if the data strongly supports Ha or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deliver the verdict:**\n",
    "    - If the evidence overwhelmingly favors Ha, we reject H0 and accept your hunch might be true (but there's always a chance of error).\n",
    "    - If the evidence aligns with H0, we hold off on your hunch, but it doesn't mean it's definitely false.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps make informed decisions based on evidence, not just guesses.\n",

    "   - **Reject Ho:** If the results are very unlikely under Ho (low p-value), you can reject it and support Ha.\n",
    "   - **Fail to reject Ho:** If the results could happen often even if Ho were true (high p-value), you don't have enough evidence to reject it.\n",
